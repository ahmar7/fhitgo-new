            FHIR-managed services involve outsourcing the management of
            healthcare data and systems that adhere to the Fast Healthcare
            Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. Managed services in the
            context of FHIR can be valuable for healthcare organizations looking
            to offload the complexities of system administration, maintenance,
            and ongoing support to a specialized service provider.&nbsp;
